Hi, I’m @HedgeWizardly! I enjoy fixing, planning, problem solving, programming, art & design, and.. well, a bit of everything, really!

Currently playing around with nodejs apps, and after a few successful things made on the glitch website, I'm now trying to figure out how to deploy and host said apps without the training wheels, so to speak. It's hard.
