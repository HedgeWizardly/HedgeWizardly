ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HedgeWizardly! Your friendly neighbourhood wizard. I enjoy planning, problem solving, programming, art & design, and a bit of everything, really!

Currently working on a few little Twitch chatbots:

âœ… PokÃ©mon Type Assistant (ProfessorHedge): Tells you offensive and defensive properties of a given PokÃ©mon type!
ðŸ›  Bee Facts! (beefactsbot): Provides a random bee fact from https://bee-facts-official.tumblr.com/ (Credit to WillowJade for the tumblr!)
ðŸ›  TCGO Code Redemptions (PumpkaBot): Allows you to automatically send codes via whisper to chat members using channel point redemptions to redeem them.
